## Usage

```javascript
var assignIn = require( '@stdlib/object/assign-in' );
```

#### assignIn( target, source1\[, source2\[,...,sourceN]] )

Copies enumerable own and inherited properties from one or more source objects to a target object.

```javascript
function Foo() {
    this.a = 'beep';
    return this;
}

Foo.prototype.b = 'boop';

var x = {};
var y = new Foo();

var z = assignIn( x, y );
// returns { 'a': 'beep', 'b': 'boop' }

var bool = ( z === x );
// returns true
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   If a property key is present in multiple sources, the property from the last source that defines the key prevails.
-   The target object is mutated.
-   Both string and symbol properties are copied.
